                    <p><b>Zenzai (ぜんざい)</b> is a traditional Japanese dessert soup made with azuki beans. This sweet red bean soup is served hot with mochi (rice cake) or shiratama dango (glutinous rice flour dumplings) inside the soup. </p>
            <p>Zenzai (ぜんざい, 善哉) is basically a soup made from boiling azuki beans with sugar and salt. You might have heard of a different name for this dessert. Oshiruko(お汁粉) or Shiruko is used in the east of Japan where boiled azuki beans are crushed into a smoother paste and become more watery soup than Zenzai.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
                        <li>Rinse the azuki beans carefully until water is clear. Discard any damaged beans that are floating. Drain water and transfer the beans to the pressure cooker</li>
                        <li>Add in 4 cups of water. Cover and lock the lid of your pressure cooker. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not venting.</li>
                        <li>Turn on your pressure cooker and select High Pressure for 15 minutes (10 minutes if you prefer to keep the beans slightly firm). If you’re using an Instant Pot, press “Manual” or “Pressure Cooker”, select “high pressure” and adjust the cooking time.</li>
                        <li>If you are using a stovetop pressure cooker, cook on high heat until high pressure is reached. Then reduce the heat to low to maintain the pressure for 15 minutes. </li>
                        <li>When it’s done cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure slowly release by itself for 30 minutes (Natural Release). Before opening the lid, turn the steam release handle to “Venting” and release any leftover pressure. If you’re using the stovetop pressure cooker, remove the pot from the heat and let the pressure release naturally.</li>
                        <li>Press the “Saute” button and select “Low” heat. Let the sugar dissolved completely, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>After cooking for 5 minutes, the soup will be a bit darker in color, too. Keep warm and start preparing the mochi.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Cut the kirimochi into halves or quarters and place them in the toaster oven (or the oven). If you're using the fresh homemade mochi, add it in the soup to warm up. If it's frozen, then boil it in a pot till soft.</li>
                        <li>Toast the mochi until puffed up and nicely brown, about 10-12 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Serve the red bean soup and mochi in a bowl and enjoy!</li>
